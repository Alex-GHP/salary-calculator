# Salary calculator

This script is meant to automate a boring task I do once every month, and do it more precisely:

* Calculate my salary based on the shifts worked (4 different shifts).

* Calculate based on the night shift hours and weekend hours bonuses.

* Keep track by storing the data into a Google Sheets.
